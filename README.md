# Components
A list of components are included with Moondust Project

## Moondust Engine

![Moondust Engine](https://github.com/WohlSoft/Moondust-Project/blob/master/Engine/_resources/icon/cat_256.png)

The Moondust Engine is the main part of the Moondust Project, allowing users to play levels and episodes.

Provides a compatibility layer with the legacy game engine (SMBX Engine 1.3) (when used configuration packages which are following [SMBX64 Standard](http://wohlsoft.ru/pgewiki/SMBX64)).

:point_up: **Note** This component is experimental and has not completed base implementation, but can be used for various testing.

[More information on the PGE Wiki...](http://wohlsoft.ru/pgewiki/Moondust_Engine)


## Development Kit
This is a set of tools used for creating levels and episodes for the Moondust Engine and also used to develop levels and episodes for some other projects too.

### Editor

The PGE Editor is the main development tool, allowing the creation and editing of levels, world maps, and NPC configurations. Maintenance utilities are also provided.

Provides a compatibility layer with the legacy game engine (SMBX Engine 1.3) (when used configuration packages which are following [SMBX64 Standard](http://wohlsoft.ru/pgewiki/SMBX64)).

Music Player is a lightweight music player based on [SDL Mixer X audio library](http://wohlsoft.ru/pgewiki/SDL_Mixer_X) to test music files (include [OGG files with a loop tags](http://wohlsoft.ru/pgewiki/How_To:_Looping_music_files))


### Maintainer wizard

This is a small and user-friendly graphical utility that allows you to process and convert various stuff like level and episode data, music files, graphic resources, etc.


### GIFs to PNG Converter

This is a small console utility that merges bit-mask-based GIF pairs used in the legacy engine into PNG format with alpha channel (semi-transparency) support.

### PNG to GIFs Converter

This is a small console utility that converts PNG images into a pair of GIF files for bit-mask algorithm rendering, simplifying the creation of graphics for the legacy engine.

### LazyFix tool

### Palette filter tool

This is a small console utility that adjusts the colors of a given image with the reference picture taken as a palette.
