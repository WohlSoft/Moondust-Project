<p><strong>PGE Editor </strong>- is a flexible, universal editor for levels,
world maps and NPC configurations. With them you can create own levels, world
maps, episodes and even whole games!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Editor have a lots of tools which will help you to create your levels and
worlds convetient, fast, progressive and <span
class="ref_result">qualitative!</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>PGE Editor - is a part of developing PGE Project which based on SMBX64
standard - a tech stuff of SMBX Engine. PGE Project going to be successof of
old SMBX Engine to give more freedom of customization and giving able use it
more useful for creation of any platform games!</p>

<p> </p>

<p><em>PGE Editor designed to have most of features in the menus and on the
toolbar</em>: you can switch between sections - separated sub-areas or rooms;
place player's start/spawn point, take placing of physical environments (water,
quicksand); lock or unlock items of target type to keep them in safe; show/hide
some toolboxes - helpful boxes which contains most of settings of items,
section, etc. Also you can copy selected items or paste them from clipboard
back. PGE Editor have a status bar where you can see some difference messages.
When you will work with items on the level and on the world map, to have access
to their properties you have the context menu to use. [<strong>Context
menu</strong> is a useful menu with settings and features which can be opened
by right (or left for lefthander mouse) mouse button click].</p>

<p></p>

<p>PGE Editor has the advanced tools in the "Tools" menu where you can find
variouse graphics and audio converters, fixing and cleanup wizards which will
help you to fix errors in the presented stuff. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Unlike original SMBX Editor, PGE Editor uses multi-selection concept which
gives ability to work with multiple items at same time. Instead of each item
dragging to change their properties, <em>you have able use a context menu</em>.
You also have able to set same properties to multiple items at one! You can
copy, you can paste your stuff into another level/world, you can undo any junk
changes (and redo them too). With placing mode you have useful features like
line, rectangle, flood-fill which help you place items more convenient. With
"Overwrite mode" you can even replace items on the map without pre-deleting of
them!</p>

<p> </p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline">PGE Editor unlike original SMBX have no
bugs which was in the SMBX before:</p>

<p>- you have full freedom with using of decimal values in the npc.txt files
(they are opens freely and safely)</p>

<p>- you have full freedom to use custom sceneries in range 32-65 on the world
map with correct saving of file (SMBX crashing when you try to save world map
with those items).</p>

<p>- you will don't flood with vines or with sceneries when you try to put them
to map.</p>

<p>- flood-fill is safe, if you was accidental flooded outer space,
flood-filling process will be aborted after 3 sec. which will give you able
undo it and fix your wrongs without re-opening of editor.</p>

<p>- you will never get "overflow" message because PGE Editor have more space
to hold your items. If you try to save level or world into SMBX format, you
will be noticed about exiding of it's limit which giving you able remove junk
items to take able open your level in the SMBX correctly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you don't like regular item box with categories and filter search, you
have able use <strong>Tileset Item Box</strong> which giving you tileset box
which more similar to original SMBX toolbox, but you have special "Custom" tab
where you have able to make your own tilesets! </p>
