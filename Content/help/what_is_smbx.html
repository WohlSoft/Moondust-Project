<h1 style="text-align: left;">SMBX - What is it?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">History:</span></span><br /><br />In the year 2009, Andrew "Redigit" 
			Spinks began work on the game: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Super Mario Brothers X</span>. Gradually the 
			game gathered a following among fans of the Mario game series. <br />
			<center><img alt="" src="images/smbx_scr.png" height="225" width="300" /></center><br />In my opinion, it is perhaps one of the all-time best Mario fan games.
			It combined gameplay elements from games such as Super Mario Bros, 
			by Super Mario Bros. 2, SMB 3, Super Mario World, and the Legend of 
			Zelda, etc. The built-in level editor allows the user to not only 
			edit levels, along with an engine to debug them in real time, 
			but also allows the player to create full-fledged episodes with a 
			plot!<br /><br />Unfortunately in 2011, Redigit received a call from the 
			lawyers of Nintendo, who threatened him and demanded he remove SMBX 
			and stop any further development. After some time, the 
			supermariobrothers.org domain was also taken over by Nintendo. So 
			such a remarkable project was killed. <br /><br />But even so, it 
			continued to played. A lot of "episodes" have been made for SMBX, 
			and the game is still very popular. However, the game was not perfect.
			The game would often overload the processor to 100%, even when the
			user is not performing tasks or using other programs.<br /><br />There 
			were several attempts to revive the project, but they all failed.<br /><br />The 
			main mistake: <strong>the game was published UNDER A COPYRIGHTED BRAND</strong>.<br />
			<center><img alt="" src="images/brand_theft.png" height="188" width="250" /></center><br />Redigit was making money off SMBX with ads located in the SMBX
			installer, on his forums, and on his website. Redigit was making
			money with Nintendo's brand and characters, without permission.
			Nintendo didn't approve of this and therefore SMBX was shut down.<br /><br />
			<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SMBX now:</span></span>
			<br /><br />Even today, SMBX still is in demand, many people still 
			create new levels and episodes, even custom programs that can
			be used with SMBX.<br /><br />
