- Playable character can be harmed by dangerous surfaces and will die in lava
- Experimental support of slopes
- Player can talk with NPC's
- better work of collisions, but some things are still experimental
- better V-Sync control

0.2.2.4-alpha (First entry of engine change-log)
- Experimental engine part which provides ability play SMBX-compatible levels and episodes
with their configuration packages. Provides partial implementation of SMBX64 standard which wasn't finished yet. Partial implementation of NPC-AI with ability to code NPC's in LUA.
- Physics are completely replaced with own coded physical engine
- Working NPC-AI system with support NPC's coded in the Lua
- Exits works!
- Kill effects [are not works perfect, need a lot of work, but there are works fine]
- Added generators!
- Player can climb on NPC-based climbable walls, not only on the BGO-based!
- Fixed a lot of bugs
- NPC's finally can be spawned from blocks where there are was included!
- Added support of the layers and basic events! [layers: show, hide, toggle;
message box; play SFX; trigger another event; auto-scroll speed, changing of limit
borders per section, toggling section background, toggling section music,
other event actions are not implemented yet].
Working event triggers: block destroy, hit, empty-layer; NPC died, activated, empty layer
[talk is not implemented yet!]
- Fixed random crash caused by lua activation event when camera caught a corpse of NPC
- Fixed slow performance caused by bad time delay function
- Player finally can ride on NPC's heads [anyway, is not finished yet]
- Basic Detectors API for NPC-AI which giving able to catch objects came to specific area
- Fixed bug with super-fast game loop
- Stomp-able NPC's are can be stomped!
- Work with a speed-summing part of physical engine gives ability to stay and ride on the moving objects
- Fixed imperfection with auto-closing of message box while "run" or "jump" key are holding
- Episode/Level lists are no more freezing engine!
- Working auto scrolling of sections has been implemented! (Unlike SMBX, auto-scroll internally
is an option of specific section which will works anyway, even you entered into this section from a side,
you will get auto-scrolling in this section)
