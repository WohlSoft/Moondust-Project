3.0-beta:
* Fixed the frames data compatibility with SMBX2 which requires all frames presented at the calibration file
* Added the mount displaying to help calibrate the mount-riding frames
* Turned the frame selection dialogue into non-modal to simplify the general workflow
* Added mouse support for the coarse movement of the hitbox at the preview box directly
* Majorly reworked the main window
* Added the compatibility mode to target calibrations for different engines and provide a relevant hint for every option
* Fixed the accuracy of the grabbed item rendering, compared with the SMBX code
beta2
* Fixed processing of paths while reading/writing INI files
* Added an ability to make full mirror of the SMBX-format sprite (copy all frames and hitboxes from one side to another)
* Added an action to clean image data of frames not marked as used (not marked by a green check at the frame selection toolbox)

2.3
* Begin the changelog
* Behavior now is more user-friendly: automation, question boxes, menus, etc.
